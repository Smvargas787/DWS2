                Based from the Bronx, Ny, the Yankees are one of the oldest MLB teams to have swept the land of baseball. Originally started as the New York Highlanders before taking the "Yankees" as their new official name in 1913. The Yankees are owned by the Yankees Global Enterprises and by the Steinbrenner family. George Steinbrenner purchased the team and former catcher Joe Girardi is the current Coach of the Yankees due to it.

                One of the most successful franchises in professional sports history, the Yankees have won 18 division titles, 40 AL pennants, and 27 World Series championships, all of which are MLB records. Forty-four Yankees players and 11 Yankees managers have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, and Yogi Berra. In pursuit of winning championships, the franchise has utilized a large payroll to recruit talent, particularly under former owner George Steinbrenner. In 2013, the Yankees are the highest valued sports franchise in the United States, and fourth in the world, with an estimated value of approximately $2.3 billion. Due in part to their success, the Yankees have garnered enormous popularity worldwide and a dedicated fanbase, as well as widespread enmity from fans of other MLB teams; the team's intense rivalry with the Boston Red Sox is one of the most well-known rivalries in sports.
